# WebSocketTest

This is a Qucik & Dirty implementation!

How to use:

Project can run only on actual devices.

Server needs to open a hotspot.

Connect client device to server's hotspot.

Start the server.

Start the client.

Transmit data from server.

Disconnect both when done.

Data is transmitted via WebSockets over Server's Wi-Fi hotspot.

Data is produced on server by encoding 1080p @ 8 Mb/s H.264 video from camera.

To switch between Telegraph & PSWebSocketServer, change the value of the boolean 'useTelegraph' in TestServer.swift
